Litecoin (P2P electronic cash system)

Litecoin aims to be a coin that is like silver to Bitcoin's gold.
It manages to maintain the unique traits and attributes of Bitcoin, 
while adding to the mixture CPU-specific mining and a 2.5 minute 
block rate. Litecoin uses Scrypt as a proof-of-work scheme. 
Scrypt uses the low-latency cache memory of modern processors to
provide greater hash-speeds on CPUs in comparison to GPUs.

This requires: qrencode

UPNP is disabled, it requires miniupnpc, which is not available on SBo.

Package provides both, litecoin-qt (GUI) and litecoind (CLI).
