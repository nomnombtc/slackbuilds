BitcoinUnlimited (P2P electronic cash system)

Every node operator or miner can currently choose their own
blocksize limit by modifying their client. Bitcoin Unlimited
makes the process easier by providing a configurable option
for the accepted and generated blocksize via a GUI menu.

Bitcoin Unlimited further provides a user-configurable failsafe
setting allowing you to accept a block larger than your maximum
accepted blocksize if it reaches a certain number of blocks
deep in the chain.

The Bitcoin Unlimited client is not a competitive block scaling
proposal like BIP-101, BIP-102, etc. Instead it tracks consensus.
This means that it tracks the blockchain that the hash power majority
follows, irrespective of blocksize, and signals its ability to accept
larger blocks via protocol and block versioning fields.

qrencode is an optional but strongly recommended dependency.
