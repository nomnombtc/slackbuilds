bitcoinclassic (P2P electronic cash system)

Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system
that is completely decentralized, without the need for a central
server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their
own money and transact directly with each other, with the help
of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

This Bitcoin client builds the backbone of the bitcoin network.
It downloads, verifies and distributes the blockchain to other
peers in the network. It uses lots of diskspace and bandwidth.
If you just want to send and receive Bitcoins you should look at
a light client like Electrum.

Bitcoin Classic is currently a one-time increase in total amount of
transaction data permitted in a block from 1MB to 2MB, with limits on
signature operations and hashing.

Read the block size increase BIP for more information.

In the future Bitcoin Classic will continue to release updates that are in
line with Satoshiâ€™s whitepaper & vision, and are agreed upon by the community.

qrencode is an optional but strongly recommended dependency.
