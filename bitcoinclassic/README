bitcoinclassic (P2P electronic cash system)

Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system
that is completely decentralized, without the need for a central
server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their
own money and transact directly with each other, with the help
of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

This Bitcoin client builds the backbone of the bitcoin network.
It downloads, verifies and distributes the blockchain to other
peers in the network. It uses lots of diskspace and bandwidth.
If you just want to send and receive Bitcoins you should look at
a light client like Electrum.

Bitcoin Classic has removed the 1MB centrally planned maximum
block size limits from its software and gives tools to the miners
and users to protect themselves from malicious actors at the same
time. We call that the accept limit.

The main change is that a Bitcoin Classic node can now be configured
manually to have any block size limit.

First there is the new blocksizeacceptlimit config setting that allows
a user to limit blocks by size they will accept from the network.
For instance if the user would set blocksizeacceptlimit=4.2 this states
that any block over 4.2MB is rejected as too large.

The old config option blockmaxsize is unchanged and this is the option
that miners set to determine the maximum block size they would create.

The additional change is that Bitcoin Classic creates block templates
for miners which put the blocksizeacceptlimit value in the coinbase
comment. This has the effect that a miner's limits are stored in the
blockchain and for everyone available to see. Any miner can check the
blockchain and find out what a safe blockmaxsize setting will get his
blocks accepted by other miners.

In the future Bitcoin Classic will continue to release updates that are in
line with Satoshiâ€™s whitepaper & vision, and are agreed upon by the community.

qrencode is an optional but strongly recommended dependency.
